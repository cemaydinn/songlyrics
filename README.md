# Song Lyrics Semantic Similarity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores semantic similarity between song lyrics using advanced natural language processing techniques, specifically word embeddings and cosine similarity calculation.

## Key Features
- Word embedding analysis using GloVe pre-trained vectors
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Vector representation of song lyrics
- Cosine similarity calculation between lyrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- GloVe Word Embeddings

## Methodology
1. Load GloVe word embeddings
2. Preprocess song lyrics text
3. Convert words to vector representations
4. Calculate average word vector for each song
5. Compute cosine similarity between song vectors

## Sample Songs Analyzed
- "Till I Collapse" by Eminem
- "Walk" by (Artist Name)

## Results
- Cosine Similarity Score: 0.863 (86.3% semantic similarity)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, nltk
- GloVe pre-trained word embeddings

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/song-lyrics-similarity.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```python
# Example code snippet demonstrating similarity calculation
lyrics_similarity = calculate_song_similarity(song1_lyrics, song2_lyrics)
```

## Future Improvements
- Support for more complex embedding techniques
- Visualization of semantic relationships
- Expanded song lyric dataset
