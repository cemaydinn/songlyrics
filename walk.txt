Used to run down this road With my heart on fire Now I'm sitting right here by the side Like a bird on the wire See my dreams passing by And I realize The day that I quit Is the day I expire Woah-oh-oh, I gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on, oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, I'm shaking the dirt from my bones All I gotta do is Walk I'm fighting and I'm bleeding I don't give up, I walk My hope, my love, my reason They guide me as I walk Like Hannibal over the mountains I gotta keep moving, I won't stop Keep on walking, watch out Here I'm coming Walk (walk), walk (walk) Walk (walk), walk (walk) Ain't no knocking me over I keep bouncing back Now I'm done with the noise in my head Yeah, I follow my track A battle for gold And a dream in my soul In times when I fail I shake off the pain and Woah-oh-oh, I gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on, oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, I'm shaking the dirt from my bones And all I gotta do is Walk I'm fighting and I'm bleeding I don't give up, I walk My hope, my love, my reason They guide me as I walk Like Hannibal over the mountains I gotta keep moving, I won't stop Keep on walking, watch out Here I'm coming Walk (walk), walk (walk) Walk (walk), walk (walk) Watch me as I walk Walk (walk), walk (walk) I gotta keep moving, I won't stop Keep on walking, watch out Here I'm coming Sitting and waiting For better days Or facing the battle And fight for a change I've made my decision It's clearing the haze In times when I fail I'm taking the pain I'm on my way Walk I'm fighting and I'm bleeding I don't give up, I walk My hope, my love, my reason They guide me as I walk Like Hannibal over the mountains I gotta keep moving, I won't stop Keep on walking, watch out Here I'm coming Walk (walk), walk (walk) Walk (walk), walk (walk) Watch me as I walk Walk (walk), walk (walk) I gotta keep moving, I won't stop Keep on walking, watch out Here I'm coming
